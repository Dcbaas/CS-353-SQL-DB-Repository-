Every query is worth 2 point. There is no partial credit for a
partially working query - think of this hwk as a large program and each query is a small part of the program.

Implement the queries below by ***editing this file*** to include
your name and your SQL code in the indicated places.   
--
(C)
IMPORTANT:
